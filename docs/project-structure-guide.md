# üöÄ Project Structure Guide & Best Practices üöÄ

This document provides a clear guide to the project's file structure. Following these principles will help keep the codebase clean, scalable, and easy for anyone to understand.

## üìÇ Core Philosophy

The project is divided into logical domains. The goal is to separate concerns, making code more reusable and predictable.

-   **`public/`**: This is the user-facing part of the application. It contains the main `index.html` (which acts as a Single Page Application or SPA), any other standalone pages (`item-details.html`), and the JavaScript/CSS files that specifically control them.

-   **`shared/`**: This is the heart of the application. It contains code that is designed to be **reused** across all parts of the app (public, admin, and developer). This includes UI components (like cards and toasts), HTML partials (header, footer), and utility functions (data fetching, authentication logic).

-   **`admin/` & `developer/`**: These are self-contained sections for the Admin Panel and Developer Tools, respectively. They have their own assets, pages, and scripts. They can (and should) import code from the `shared/` directory.

-   **`firebase/`**: This folder centralizes all mock data and will later hold the actual Firebase configuration and rules.

## üó∫Ô∏è Detailed Folder Breakdown & Where to Put New Files

Use this guide to understand where new files should be created.

### `public/` - The Customer-Facing App

| Folder Path                      | Purpose                                                              | Example                                         |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `public/pages/`                  | Standalone HTML pages that are not part of the main SPA.             | `item-details.html`                             |
| `public/scripts/`                | Logic for standalone pages and the main entry point.                 | `item-details.js`, `main.js`                    |
| `public/scripts/views/`          | **Logic for each bottom navigation tab (view)** in the SPA.          | `explore-view.js`, `cart-view.js`               |
| `public/styles/`                 | CSS specific to standalone pages.                                    | `item-details.css`                              |
| `public/assets/`                 | Images and other assets used only in the public section.             | `vivek.jpg` (user profile picture)              |

### `shared/` - The Reusable Core

| Folder Path                      | Purpose                                                              | Example                                         |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `shared/components/`             | **Reusable UI components.** Each component has its own folder.       | `card/`, `toast/`, `feedback-modal/`            |
| `shared/partials/`               | Reusable HTML snippets loaded into pages.                            | `header.html`, `footer.html`, `bottom-nav.html` |
| `shared/utils/`                  | **Reusable helper functions** used across the entire app.            | `partial-loader.js`, `data-service.js`, `auth.js` (future) |
| `shared/styles/`                 | Global CSS files that apply to the whole app.                        | `main.css`, `theme.css`                   |
| `shared/assets/`                 | Global assets used everywhere.                                       | `app-logo.png`, `mock-images/`                  |

### `admin/` - The Shop Owner's Panel

| Folder Path                      | Purpose                                                              | Example                                         |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `admin/pages/`                   | Standalone HTML pages for the admin panel.                           | `dashboard.html`, `inventory.html`              |
| `admin/scripts/views/`           | **(Future)** Logic for each admin bottom navigation tab.             | `dashboard-view.js`, `inventory-view.js`        |
| `admin/assets/`                  | Images and assets specific to the admin panel.                       | `shop-logo.jpg`                                 |

## üí° Building Out the Bottom Navigation Tabs

Here's how to structure the development for the main tabs:

### For User/Guest Tabs (`Home`, `Explore`, `Saved`, `Cart`, `Account`)

These are "views" within the main `index.html` SPA.

1.  **HTML Structure:** The container `div` for the view is in `index.html` (e.g., `<div id="saved-view" class="page-view hidden"></div>`).
2.  **JavaScript Logic:** All logic for fetching data and rendering the UI for a view goes into its own file in `public/scripts/views/`.
    -   **Example:** To build the "Saved" items page, all your code should go into `public/scripts/views/saved-view.js`.
3.  **Initialization:** The `initializeSavedView()` function is called from `public/scripts/main.js` to load it into the app.

### For Admin Tabs (`Dashboard`, `Inventory`, `Analytics`, `Requests`)

Currently, these tabs are placeholders pointing to user views. The correct, long-term structure will be:

1.  **HTML Structure:** The admin panel will likely have its own main page, like `admin/dashboard.html`, which will act as the SPA for admins.
2.  **JavaScript Logic:** The logic for each admin tab will live in a new folder: `admin/scripts/views/`.
    -   **Example:** The logic for the inventory management tab will be in `admin/scripts/views/inventory-view.js`.
3.  **Shared Components:** The admin views will reuse components from `shared/components/` (like cards, tables, etc.) to maintain a consistent look.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices & Recommendations

Your current structure is very good. Here are a few small adjustments to make it even better for the long term.

### 1. Centralize Authentication Logic

-   **Problem:** `shared/scripts/main.js` is the main entry point for `index.html`. Its primary job is to orchestrate the public-facing SPA. Placing it in `shared/` can be confusing, as `shared/` is meant for code that is *imported* by other scripts, not for a main entry point itself.
-   **Solution:** When you start implementing Firebase login/signup, create a dedicated file for it: `shared/utils/auth/auth.js`. This file will handle all user session logic (login, logout, checking user state) and can be imported by any part of the app that needs it.

### 2. Organize the `docs/` Folder

-   **Problem:** The `docs/` folder has several temporary files (`temporary.txt`, `suggesions.diff`, etc.).
-   **Solution:** Consider creating a `docs/_archive/` subfolder. Move all non--essential or temporary notes there to keep the main documentation directory clean and focused on important guides.

### 3. Clean up Mock Data

-   **Problem:** The `firebase/data/` directory contains `products.json` and `services.json`, which are likely old.
-   **Solution:** To avoid confusion, delete these files and ensure that `items.json` is the single source of truth for all mock item data.

By following this structure, the project will be much easier to scale and maintain as you add more complex features like Firebase integration and a multi-vendor marketplace.
