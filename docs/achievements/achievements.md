### ‚úÖ Feature: Professional Desktop Zoom

-   **What it does:**
    -   Desktop users can now hover over an item's image to see a magnified view.
    -   The zoom result appears in the empty space next to the image, matching the size of the item info box.
    -   The zoom is smooth, centered on the cursor, and the lens size is proportional to the zoom level.

-   **How it was implemented:**
    1.  **Dedicated Module:** All desktop zoom logic was moved to a new, reusable module: `shared/utils/cursor-zoom.js`.
    2.  **Responsive Sizing:** The `initializeDesktopHoverZoom` function now takes the `#item-info` box as a parameter to dynamically set the size of the zoom result box.
    3.  **Accurate Centering:** The zoom calculation was fixed to correctly center the magnified view on the cursor's position by using `e.clientX` and `e.clientY` and accounting for the image's natural vs. rendered size.
    4.  **Stylish UI:** The zoom lens (`#image-zoom-lens`) was styled with a blue border and a centered plus icon (`+`) for a better user experience. The result box (`#zoom-result-box`) now has a subtle shadow.

-   **Key Files Involved:**
    -   `shared/utils/cursor-zoom.js` (New)
    -   `public/scripts/item-details.js` (Updated to use the new module)
    -   `public/styles/item-details.css` (Updated with new styles for the lens and result box)

### ‚úÖ Feature: Enhanced Toast Notifications

-   **What it does:**
    -   Toast notifications are now more professional and visually appealing.
    -   They support different types (`success`, `error`, `info`) with distinct colors and icons.
    -   A subtle bounce animation makes them more noticeable.

-   **How it was implemented:**
    1.  **Global Component:** The toast was refactored into a global, reusable component located in `shared/components/toast/`.
    2.  **Typed Toasts:** The `showToast` function in `toast.js` was updated to accept a `type` parameter, which adds a corresponding class (`.success`, `.error`) to the toast element.
    3.  **CSS Animations:** New CSS was added in `toast.css` for the bounce-in animation (`cubic-bezier`) and the icon pop effect (`@keyframes toast-icon-pop`).

-   **Key Files Involved:**
    -   `shared/components/toast/toast.js`
    -   `shared/components/toast/toast.css`
    -   `shared/components/toast/toast.html`

### ‚úÖ Feature: Robust Grid Layout

-   **What it does:**
    -   Fixed a UI bug where item grids (in Cart, Saved, Suggestions) would stretch and look distorted if they contained only a few items.

-   **How it was implemented:**
    1.  **`auto-fill` vs. `auto-fit`:** In `main.css`, the grid layout was changed from `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, ...)` to `repeat(auto-fill, ...)`. `auto-fill` creates empty tracks instead of stretching existing items, preserving their intended size.
    2.  **Centralized Spacing:** Removed individual margins from `.item-card` and now control all spacing via the `.items-grid` container's `gap` and `padding` properties.

-   **Key Files Involved:**
    -   `shared/styles/main.css`
    -   `shared/components/card/card.css`
