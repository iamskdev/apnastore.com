# ðŸš€ Future Scope & Scalability ðŸš€

This document outlines the roadmap for mStore, detailing planned features and the architectural principles that will ensure the application can grow and scale effectively.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Roadmap: Next Steps

Our immediate focus is on transforming the application from a mock-data-driven PWA into a fully dynamic, data-driven platform.

### 1. Full Firebase Integration

This is the highest priority and the foundation for most future features.

-   **Authentication:**
    -   Implement Firebase Authentication for user (customer) and admin (shop owner) sign-up and login.
    -   Support for email/password and social logins (Google).
    -   Manage user roles (`guest`, `user`, `admin`) securely using custom claims.

-   **Database (Firestore):**
    -   Migrate all mock data from `/firebase/data/*.json` to Firestore collections.
    -   Create collections for `items`, `users`, `shops`, `categories`, `orders`, etc.
    -   Implement real-time data fetching so that changes in the database reflect instantly in the app.

-   **Storage (Cloud Storage):**
    -   Allow admins to upload product/service images directly to Cloud Storage.
    -   Store user profile pictures and other media assets.

## ðŸ“ˆ Scalability & Long-Term Vision

Beyond the core integration, we plan to build a robust and scalable multi-vendor marketplace.

### 2. Multi-Vendor Marketplace

-   **What it does:** Allow multiple shop owners (vendors) to register and manage their own stores on the platform.
-   **How it will be implemented:**
    -   Each `item` in Firestore will be linked to a `shopId`.
    -   The "Explore" view will aggregate items from all active shops.
    -   Users will be able to filter by shop or view a specific shop's profile page.
    -   The Admin Dashboard will be tailored for each logged-in vendor to manage only their inventory, orders, and analytics.

### 3. Advanced PWA & Native Features

-   **What it does:** Enhance the app-like experience with deeper offline capabilities and native device features.
-   **How it will be implemented:**
    -   **Robust Offline Mode:** Use the service worker to cache not just the app shell, but also API data (like product lists) and images for a true offline browsing experience.
    -   **Push Notifications:** Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send notifications for order status updates, promotions, or when an out-of-stock item is available again (fulfilling the "Notify Me" feature).
    -   **Background Sync:** Allow users to perform actions like adding to cart while offline, and sync the data automatically when the connection is restored.

### 4. Performance & Optimization

-   **What it does:** Ensure the app remains fast and responsive as it grows.
-   **How it will be implemented:**
    -   **Code Splitting:** Use dynamic `import()` not just for modules but for entire views, so the browser only loads the code needed for the current screen.
    -   **Image Optimization:** Automatically resize and serve images in modern formats (like WebP) using a service like Firebase Extensions (e.g., Resize Images).
    -   **Loading Skeletons:** Implement placeholder UIs (skeletons) that appear while data is being fetched, improving the perceived performance.

### 5. Enhanced Admin & User Features

-   **Admin Dashboard:** Build out the admin-specific views for inventory management, order processing, and sales analytics with charts and reports.
-   **User Checkout Flow:** Create a complete multi-step checkout process, including address selection, payment options (placeholder/dummy), and order confirmation.
-   **Advanced Search:** Enhance the search with filters (by price, rating, brand) and sorting options.

This structured approach ensures that as new features are added, the application's foundation remains solid, maintainable, and ready for future growth.
